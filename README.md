# 2048 (Eeveelution)!!

## Project Background

The 2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game that was previously developed by Italian Web Developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub. Likewise, as a budding software developer, I have a strong desire to create a game that I can call my own. This game was originally developed in Javascript and CSS over a weekend and it is the exact same scenario for myself personally. How apt can that be!

A marriage between my interest in cute stuff and my passion for software engineering had given birth to Eeveelution!

## Project Description
The objective of the game is to slide tiles on a grid to merge them together to achieve the ultimate goal of the cutest Eevee evolution form.
