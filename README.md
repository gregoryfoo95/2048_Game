# 2048 (Eeveelution)!!

## Project Background

The 2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game that was previously developed by Italian Web Developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub. Likewise, as a budding software developer, I have a strong desire to create a game that I can call my own. This game was originally developed in Javascript and CSS over a weekend and it is the exact same scenario for myself personally. How apt can that be!

## Project Description
The objective of the game is to slide tiles on a grid to merge them together to achieve the ultimate goal of the cutest Eevee evolution form. 

## Timeframe

4 Working Days

## Deployment 

The game is deployed on Github pages and you can access the game here:
https://gregoryfoo95.github.io/2048_Game/

## Technologies Utilized

- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- Git for Version Control
- Window Powershell for Command Line Prompt

## Gameplay!

The goal of the game is to attain the "Team Eevee" badge, with a scoreboard attached as well with the summation of the inherent values of all merged tiles. The player must utilise the keyboard directional keys to dictate the movement of the tiles.

| As a User, I ...                         |                 and this happens!    
| :--------------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------|
| load the browser page                    |  observe a board with two tiles of "Pokeballs"
| press a keyboard arrow key               |  observe all tiles flush towards select direction
| see a change in images                   |  similar neighbouring tiles merged and summed together
|                                          |  score increases by summed value (points start from 2 till 2048 for   respective tiles)
| see a random addition of "Pokeball" tile |  a new "Pokeball" tile is generated for continuation
| see a "Team Eevee" tile generated        |  sees congratulatory message on the display board at the top
